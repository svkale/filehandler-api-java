# FileHandler API

The FileHandler API can be used as the base library for building Apps, which requires a client-server interface for operations related to files. The FileHandler class comes with all the basic functionalities, such as 'create new file', 'delete existing files', 'read a file', 'write a file' etc. These features are executed in an isolated mode, where the access for the resources / files outside of the environment set by the user are denied.
